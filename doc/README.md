### Introduction

The plugin Beam Adpater allows to have a dynamic implementation of the FEM beam elements.
The underlying mechanical fundations are based on beam theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler–Bernoulli_beam_theory), that have been extended to large transformation using corotational formualation.
These elements are particularly useful for modeling 1D like deformable structures (cables, threads, flexible needles, catheters, etc...).


This tutorial presents the mechanical and implementation basis of the plugin Beam Adpater.
It also presents some examples of use and lists the current limitations.

#### This Documentation covers:
