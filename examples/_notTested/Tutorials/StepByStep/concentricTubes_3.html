		In this step, we insert a second tube inside the first.

		We add a second rest shape, interpolation, force field and visualization. In this scene, we changed the way of loading the rest shape. The rest shape are generated procedurally with parameters. This has the advantage of computing a continuous shape, rather than a discrete one loaded in a file. The second rest shape is almost the same as the first one. The difference is a non-null straight length that allows the second tube to be entirely out of the first one. Moreover, the rotation of the second tube is set to 180Â°, compared to the first one.

		To select the tube to control, use <b> ctrl + 0</b> to select tube 0 and <b> ctrl + 1</b> to select tube 1
